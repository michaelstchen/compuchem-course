# compuchem-course: Code and Results for Computational Chemistry Course

Course: UC Berkeley's Chem 195

Instructor: Prof. Phillip Geissler

Language: MATLAB

I have placed each assignments work inside its own folder. Within those folders:
  - The code can be found in the folder "code/"
  - The LaTeX script and accompanying images/figures can be found in "Latex/"
  - A write up with figures and analysis is given in "psXX Results.pdf"
 
The assignment folders are named with the method used and the system we are examining.
